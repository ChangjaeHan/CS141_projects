# CS141_projects
I've learned how to:
1. use struct and class, and know how they are different from each other
2. build sort algorithm by name, number etc
3. utilize user-defined function to manage efficient code

# project1 #
// banking system //
This program can read files including clients' financial information and execute 5 commands 
1. Deposit (+) : Add deposit
2. Withdrawal (-) : Subtract deposit
3. Check balance (?) : Check total balance
4. Find Largest balance (^) : Find the account with the largest balance
5. List all accounts and balances (* ) : Show all of the accounts and balances
6. Quit (x)

# project2 #
// banking system v 2.0 //
This program is extended version of project1. First of all, this program can handle flexible number of files and clients.
Secondly, this program can list accounts that fall within low....high (* )

# project3 #
// simple python interpreter // 
This program can interpret simple python codes built in C++ programming language.
1. assignment & operator
2. print statement
3. If-else (incomplete)

# project4 #
// analyzing DIVVY (bike) data //
This program can input 2 types of flexible number of files; one is stations in the DIVVY system, and the other is bike trips
This handles 8 commands;
1. Quick Statistics : Output the total # of stations, trips, and capacity
2. Summary of bike durations : Show the summary of bike durations
3. Histogram of starting times : Categorizes the trips into 1 of 24 categories based on the starting hour
4. Stations near me : Find all stations near a given position by using mathmatical user-defined function
5. List all stations : List all stations in alphabetical order by name
6. Find stations : Perform a case-sensitive search of the stations whose name includes the word input by the user
7. Find trips within timespan : Search the bike trips for all trips with a start time that falls within the given timespan
8. Quit

# project5 #
// Linked-lists and priority queues // 
This program comprises linked-lists and priority queues (information in detail is well-described in project 5)

# project6 #
// Class registration system //
This program is composed of principle structures and algorithms I built in project1 ~ project5
This class registration system can execute 9 commands;
1. Help : Show helps
2. Stats : Output the number of students currently enrolled and waitlisted in each class
3. List class : Output information about the specific class considering priority queues (project6 in detail)
4. Increase class capacity : Change the enrollment capacity of the specified class considering priority queues 
5. Enroll class netid : Attempt to enroll the student in the specified class considering enrollment and waitlist
6. Waitlist class netid priority : Attempt to waitlist the student in the specified class considering enrollment and waitlist
7. Process filename : Attempt to open the given filename and input commands from this file until “q” or “quit” is encountered
8. Output filename : Open the given file for output and writes the current enrollment data to this file
9. Quit
